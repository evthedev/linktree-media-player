## Setup

```
$ git clone https://github.com/evthedev/linktree-media-player.git
$ cd linktree-media-player
$ npm i
$ npm start
$ npm test
```

## Approach
* Technologies used: React (React Hooks), Typescript, Redux, Mapbox, Chart.js, Styled Components, Sass generated layout utility classes, FontAwesome.
* The app imports data directly from either a Ts or Json file, instead of reading off a CSV file.
* The following items were descoped from the requirements, after discussion with Rob: Directory view, filters, search bar, Action button, differentiated markers


## Possible areas of improvement
* Read and fetch from csv instead of json
* Better mock Jest dispatch functions in tests
* Style chart tooltips better
* Style chart on responsive (< iPad) better
